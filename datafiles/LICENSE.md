# Phantasia's Daydream

Version 1.0, June 2025

**This license may be updated. Always refer to the latest official version for current terms.**

Copyright (c) 2025 Phantasia's Daydream. All rights reserved.

This License Agreement is made between the author(s) of the Software and any person or entity who obtains a copy of this Software and/or its associated files.

By using the Software, the Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

## 0. Summary

This license allows nearly all personal uses, including public showcases with credit and private sharing of modified source code from official sources.

The license protects the user's rights while offering open development flexibility, such as allowing code modification and non-commercial publishing, or commercial publishing of the source code or software if it includes significant modifications or has been approved by the author.

Public use of the full game is allowed with proper credit and links. Assets require permission for public commercial use, with exceptions.

Fan works that do not include any original assets (e.g., fan art) do not require credit.

Usage of assets, software, or source code for malicious, misleading, or harmful projects is strictly prohibited.

This license is a custom agreement written by the author and is not based on any existing license.

## 1. Definitions

- **Game** refers to the overall experience and structure which includes its story, mechanics, design, characters, and presentation as a unified creative work. This includes the Software, Assets, and Source Code as components that together form the complete game.

- **Software** refers to the compiled or executable version of the Source Code that runs as the playable game.

- **Source Code** refers to all human-readable code files related to the project, including scripts, configuration files, and any code hosted on the official GitHub repository or other authorized sources.

- **Assets** refers to any visual, audio, or data files used by the Software, such as textures, music, and sound effects.

- **Author** refers to the original creator(s) of the Source Code, Assets, and any legally credited contributors. In this license, primarily refers to Zhen.

- **Licensee** refers to any person or entity who obtains a copy of the Software and/or its associated files under this License Agreement.

- **Official Sources** refers to platforms or repositories directly controlled by the Author, including the official GitHub repository and listed game pages.

- **Personal Use** refers to use by the Licensee that does not involve commercial sale or mass public redistribution (e.g., playing the game, sharing with friends, making private mods).

- **Commercial Use** refers to use involving any financial gain, such as donations, selling the Software, distributing modified versions for profit, or using the Assets in monetized content.

- **Significant Changes** refers to the substantial alterations, additions, or modifications to the Software, Source Code, or Assets that fundamentally transform the original work into a distinct new creation or a significantly enhanced version, going beyond minor tweaks, bug fixes, or simple recompilations. Such changes typically involve extensive new content, fundamental re-engineering, or the creation of a distinctly different user experience compared to the original.

### 1.1. Exemptions

Exemptions apply when a specific part of the Software is explicitly marked as not owned by the Author. These parts are not covered under this license.

    Any part of the "Source Code" or "Assets" does not fall under this license if it is clearly stated that the Author did not create it.

    This may be indicated within the code itself, in comments or metadata, or elsewhere within the Game or Software (e.g., credits, or documentation).

## 2. Usage

This section outlines what the Licensee is allowed to do with the Software, Source Code, and Assets both publicly and privately-under the terms of this license.

Any part of the Software or Source Code not created by the Author is not bound to this license and may be disregarded from Public Usage and Private Usage clauses.

### 2.1. Public Usage

The Software may be showcased or discussed in public media (e.g., streams, videos, articles). Modified versions of the Source Code may be published publicly provided that:

- Proper credit is given to the original Author.
- A link to the official Software or repository is included.
- The published version is not sold or monetized unless it contains Significant Changes or has been approved by the Author.
- Assets require explicit permission for public commercial use.
- Usage does not involve malicious, misleading, or harmful intent.

### 2.2. Private Usage

The Software may be copied for personal use or for contributing to its development. The Licensee may modify and share the Source Code privately provided that:

- Credit is retained within the Source Code or documentation.
- The modified version is not publicly distributed or sold.
- Usage does not involve malicious, misleading, or harmful intent.

## 3. Publishing and Attribution

This section defines how the Licensee may publish works based on the Software, and the requirements for crediting the original Author.

### 3.1. Publishing Modified Works

Modified versions of the Source Code may be published, provided that:

- Proper credit is given to the original Author in both the project and its documentation.
- A clear notice is included stating the project is based on or derived from the Software.
- A link to the official Software or repository is included.
- The Licensee does not misrepresent the origin of the Software.
- Commercial publishing of modified versions must either:
    - Include significant original contributions, or
    - Be explicitly approved by the Author.

### 3.2. Attribution Requirements

Whenever the Software, Source Code, or any derived work is shared, the following must be included:

- The name of the Game.
- Credit the Author as the original creator.
- A visible link to the official game or source repository (when possible).
- A note indicating any modifications made, if applicable.

### 3.3. Derivative Works

Derivative works such as fan art, fan games, remixes, or adaptations are allowed under the following conditions:

- Credit must be given clearly when using any original ideas from the Game.
- Original Assets may not be reused without permission.
- Fan works must not misrepresent themselves as official or cause harm to the reputation of the original Game or its Author.

### 3.4. Sub-Licensing

The Licensee shall not sub-license, lease, rent, or otherwise transfer rights to the Source Code or Assets, whether partially or fully, to any third party in under any circumstances.

### 3.5. Takedown Requests

The Author reserves the right to request that the Licensee stop using, including, or distributing any portion of the Source Code or Assets in their project, either partially or entirely.

If such a request is made, the Licensee will be given at least 30 days' notice to update their software and remove the specified content to comply with the request.

This 30-day countdown begins once the Author sends the takedown request.

Unless the Author grants an exception, the Licensee must publicly release an updated version of their project that fulfills the request within the 30-day period. If no update is made, the Author may request the removal of any existing versions that still contain the specified content.

Failing to comply within this timeframe without a granted exception will be considered a violation of this license.

Fan works that do not use any original Assets (e.g., drawings or cosplay) do not require permission or attribution, though credit is appreciated.

## 4. Restrictions

This section lists what the Licensee cannot do under this license.

### 4.1 Commercial Use of Assets

Assets may not be used commercially without explicit permission from the Author. This includes selling, monetizing, or using Assets in profit-driven projects.

### 4.2 Publishing Without Significant Changes

Publishing the Software or Source Code as-is for commercial purposes is prohibited. Commercial releases require Significant Changes or approval by the Author.

### 4.3 Malicious or Harmful Use

The Software, Source Code, or Assets cannot be used for any malicious, misleading, or harmful activities. This includes hacking, spreading misinformation or disinformation, or creating any sort of harmful content.

### 4.4 Misrepresentation
